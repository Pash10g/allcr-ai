# ðŸ‘€ AllCR App

AllCR App is a Streamlit application that allows users to capture real-life objects like recipes, documents, animals, vehicles, and more, and turn them into searchable documents. The app integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to JSON conversion and MongoDB Atlas for storing the extracted information.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure access to the application using an API code.
- **Image Capture**: Capture images using your device's camera.
- **OCR to JSON**: Convert captured images to JSON format using OpenAI's GPT-4.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store and retrieve the extracted information from MongoDB.
- **Search and Display**: Search and display stored documents along with their images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- OpenAI Python Client Library
- MongoDB Atlas cluster
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Haystack (for advanced search functionality)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/allcr-app.git
   cd allcr-app
   ```

   ## Installation



2. **Install the required packages:**
```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your OpenAI API key, MongoDB URI, and API code for authentication.
```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   MONGODB_ATLAS_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_uri
   API_CODE=your_api_code
```
## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
```
   streamlit run app.py
```
2. **Access the app:**
```
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
```
3. **Authenticate:**

   Enter the API code provided in your `.env` file to access the application.

4. **Capture and Process Images:**

   - Select the type of object you want to capture.
   - Use the camera to take a picture of the object.
   - The image will be processed, and the extracted text will be displayed for confirmation.
   - Save the processed document to MongoDB.

5. **Search and Display Documents:**

   - Use the search functionality to find stored documents.
   - Expand the results to view the extracted text and display the associated image.
